# Travel Weather Planner
This is a Weather app to get a 7 day forecast. 

## Functionality
It uses the Open weather api to search a city and fetch geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude).
Once it retrieves the coordinates another function makes an api call to Open Weather for the forecast. 
Out of the forecast array I have chosen to include the low temp, high temp, uv index wind speed and humidity. 

## Code Snip
![Site](./images/snip.png)
Using one api call to feed the second call latitude and longitude.
